### Array and String

- **Uncompress**: Converts a compressed string to its uncompressed form. Example: `"3a2b4c"` becomes `"aaabbcccc"`.
- **Compress**: Compresses a string by counting consecutive characters. Example: `"aaabbcccc"` becomes `"3a2b4c"`.
- **Anagrams**: Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- **Most Frequent Character**: Finds the most frequently occurring character in a string.
- **Pair Sum**: Finds a pair of indices in an array whose elements add up to a target sum.
- **Pair Product**: Finds a pair of indices in an array whose elements multiply to a target product.
- **Intersection**: Finds common elements between two arrays without duplicates.
- **Five Sort**: Moves all occurrences of `5` to the end of an array.

### Linked List

- **LinkedListValues**: Returns an array containing all values of the nodes in a linked list.
- **SumList**: Returns the sum of values in a linked list.
- **LinkedListFind**: Checks if a target value exists in the linked list.
- **GetNodeValue**: Returns the value at a given index in a linked list.
- **ReverseLinkedList**: Reverses the linked list and returns the head of the new list.
- **ZipperList**: Merges two linked lists in an alternating pattern.
- **MergeLists**: Merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
- **LongestStreak**: Returns the length of the longest consecutive streak of the same value in the linked list.
- **RemoveNode**: Deletes the first occurrence of a target value in the linked list.
- **InsertNode**: Inserts a new node with a value at a specific index in the list.
- **CreateLinkedList**: Creates a linked list from an array of values.
- **AddLists**: Adds two numbers represented by linked lists, with digits in reverse order.

### Binary Tree

- **All Tree Paths**: Returns a list of all root-to-leaf paths in the tree.
- **Level Averages**: Returns a list of average values of each level in the tree.
- **Bottom Right Value**: Finds the right-most value in the bottom-most level of the tree.
- **Breadth First Values**: Returns values of the tree nodes in breadth-first order.
- **Depth First Values**: Returns values of the tree nodes in depth-first order.
- **How High**: Returns the height of the binary tree.
- **Leaf List**: Returns a list of all leaf node values from left to right.
- **Max Root to Leaf Path Sum**: Finds the maximum sum of any root-to-leaf path.
- **Tree Path Finder**: Returns a path to a target value in the tree, if found.
- **Tree Includes**: Checks if a target value is present in the tree.
- **Tree Levels**: Returns a 2-D array where each subarray represents a level in the tree.
- **Tree Min Value**: Finds the minimum value in the binary tree.
- **Tree Sum**: Returns the sum of all values in the tree.
- **Tree Value Count**: Counts the occurrences of a target value in the tree.
